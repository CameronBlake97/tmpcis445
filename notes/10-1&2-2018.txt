salaries: [{salary: 200000, from_date:"01-01-2002", to_date:"01-01-2008"},....{"etc"}],
.......
}

Who are my employees? 
   ^ How much do they maje now?    ]-  employee
   ^ What are their titles?        ]-
   
   1. if document - just employee
   1. if relational - have to search employee and salary



document model - more stuff in one place - no need for linking
   - better for adding stuff
