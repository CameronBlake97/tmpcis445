project to reduce size reduces effeciency.
if document size is large, and can reduce, need to think of projection effeciency. Can help.
$xyz  not xyz as in word, but the value store in that    $ -> derefernces
$$ doesn't deref from doc itself but deref from pipeline
   - anything made in pipeline must be dereferenced with $$
   - stuff exists in pipeline until complete, then deleted
   
   
#1 from prev lecture        * some points
  1) identify stages
    $match
    $project
    
  2) determine order         *** GET MOST POINTS FROM THIS ON EXAM - Determine order first
    $match
    $project
    
  3) Do it
    [
     {
       $match : {qty : {$gte : 1 }}
     },
     {
       $project : { _id: 0,                  determine fields we want, operations
                    FullName : { $concat : ["$company", " ", "$name"]},
                    valueOnHand : { $multiply : ["$price", "$qty"]}
     }
    ]
    
    
    
$group
  - must do a operation, as we are squishing all documents into one
  - $push allows duplicates
  - $addtoset -> sets are unique, no duplicates
  
  
$unwind
  - must take in an arry field
  - creates new document from each arr element
  - kinda the reverse of group
  - gets rid of object id    lose ability to identify documents
  - very expensive operation, you should filter first
